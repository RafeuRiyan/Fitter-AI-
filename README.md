# 💪 Fitter AI – Your Open-Source AI Fitness Coach

**Fitter AI** is an open-source, AI-powered fitness and wellness platform built for **software engineers**, **creatives**, and **knowledge workers** who want to live healthier lives without the complexity of traditional fitness apps. Designed with developers in mind, it's not just a product — it's a movement.

## 🌍 Project Vision

> **“A healthy mind starts with a healthy body — even for those who spend 12 hours in front of a screen.”**

Fitter AI was born out of a simple question:

> _"What if your fitness coach understood your calendar, your stress, your tech life — and adapted to it?"_

In a world where most fitness apps are built for gym rats or Instagram influencers, Fitter AI is different. It's made for **you**, the coder, designer, remote worker, or tech founder who:
- Wants to get healthier, but can’t stick to rigid plans.
- Needs real advice that fits into your Zoom-packed, Uber Eats-fueled life.
- Doesn't have 2 hours to spend at the gym, but wants real, sustainable results.

We built Fitter AI to solve this — with personalization, AI-driven empathy, and simplicity.
